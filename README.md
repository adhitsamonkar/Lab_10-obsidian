# ðŸ§® Lab 10 â€“ Data Visualization and GitHub Collaboration

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To use a standard dataset in **R**, generate multiple types of plots for **data visualization**, and collaboratively manage the project using **GitHub** for version control and teamwork.

## ðŸŒ¸ 2. Dataset Information

**Dataset Used:** `iris` (built-in R dataset)

**Description:**  
The `iris` dataset contains measurements of 150 iris flowers from three different species â€” *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica*.  
It includes four numeric variables:
- **Sepal.Length**
- **Sepal.Width**
- **Petal.Length**
- **Petal.Width**

**Purpose:**  
To explore relationships and patterns among flower characteristics using multiple visualization techniques in R.

## ðŸ“Š 3. Plots Created

| Plot No. | Plot Type | Description | Contributor |
|-----------|------------|--------------|--------------|
| 1 | **Histogram** | Distribution of Sepal Length across species | Rudresh B. Achari (2330) |
| 2 | **Scatter Plot** | Relationship between Sepal and Petal Length | Sangana Ibrampurkar (2310) |
| 3 | **Box Plot** | Comparison of Petal Width across species | Rakshita Kubal (2319) |
| 4 | **Line Plot** | Average Petal and Sepal Length across species | Shripad Chodankar (2317) |
| 5 | **Bar Plot** | Count of flower samples by species | Sanika Hoble (2309) |
| 6 | **Pie Chart** | Proportion of each iris species | Unnat Umarye (2303) |
| 7 | **Heatmap** | Correlation among numeric features | Adhit Amonkar (2304) |

Each plot includes proper **titles**, **axis labels**, **legends**, and **interpretations**.
